## Concept

**Protect the Rabbit** is the output of VR workshop of school. We did brainstorming of game ideas using one day. At the end of first day, we came up with an idea that using the movement of both hands. In this game, we play the role of a god like a giant, protecting a rabbit and helping it return to the hole. There will be different hunters and traps along the way. So the left hand represents protection and can stop the rabbit; The right hand represents discipline and is used to remove hunters and traps from the path.

## Game Art

In terms of game art, the environment mainly refers to the 2D cardboard style of Mario paper, while the rabbit's shape is still in 3D form. The color of rabbit is mainly yellow warm tone, avoiding contours, in order to highlight its simple and lovely characteristics. The rabbit's has only the action of jumping. Adding the change of transform in unity will achieve the desired jumping effect finally. After completing the task of the rabbit and user test, we found that the tester was often unable to distinguish between left and right hands, so we were agreed to add a hammer to the right hand to make the distinction clear at a glance through the striking action of the hammer. After rapid completion of the hammer modeling, the desired effect was achieved.

## Feedback

This game is a simple application of VR technology, in which the interactive actions are not complex, and such cartoon style is suitable for the beginners of VR games. The final effect of this game reached our expectations, and most of the test feedback is positive. However, we also found from the feedback that the task of the game is slightly monotonous. If more factors can be added, such that the rabbit can walk around and the player needs to pay attention to the hunter beside him at any time, I think this improvement can greatly increase the challenge and playability of the game.
