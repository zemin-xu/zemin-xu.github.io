Makefile stores commands like that in Bash script. The difference is that Makefile has no the executing order we should treat it as a general principle sets where we can find several commands, called _target_.  See [GNU manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Introduction) for more.

## What's Makefile ?

> The make utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them. Makefiles contain five kinds of things: explicit rules, implicit rules, variable definitions, directives, and comments. -- GNU

## What's inside a Makefile ?

### target

A target could be a file generated by the program or an action. The latter is also called *Phony Target*. We can use _.PHONY_ to differenciate them.


```Makefile
.PHONY: clean fclean all re
```

### rule

_rule_ is the key part of Makefile.

```Makefile
# a rule look like this:
targets : prerequisites
        recipe
```

#### implicit rule

Sometimes, we don't provide a rule for a target, and _Makefile_ will find a implicit rule for it. The most used example is object file like _foo.o_ from _foo.c_. Normally, _foo.o_ is made automatically from _foo.c_ with a recipe of the form ‘$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c’.

## How to use it ?

After a _Makefile_ is prepared, we simply tape _make_ in command line to activate the default command.
