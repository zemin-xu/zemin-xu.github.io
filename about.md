# About me
Hey there, I’m Zemin.
I am a game designer who’s focused on game design and development. I am and currently in the last year of Bachelor at l’école de design Nantes Atlantique. I consider myself as an adaptive, creative and dynamic person who learns a relative skill quickly with great enthusiasm.

When I’m not working, you can catch me reading and playing games. In the world of game, there is no limit but the imagination. Reading is helpful based on that game inspirations come always from other fields. Touching as much as different experiences as a player is the other way I come closer to game design.

You can reach me out by email. – zemin.xu@yahoo.com
