Task: Enhancing human abilities in the age of AR.

# Lecture 7: Ideate

Assignment: Create and sketch and present at least three ideas.

## First idea: super memory of everyone that you have met ever

&nbsp;

With AR technology, the HMD will do face recognition of people around. The people that you have never met before will be registered in database. If there is someone that you met before in some other place, his or her shape will be emphasized with contour, with infomation like the position and time of last meeting.

&nbsp;

This ability is useful when someone is tracking you and going to commit a crime on you. Even you are not looking at him/her, the moment when the device notice his abnormal behaviour, the police will be notified. It can also be used if you would like to know the common place that you have been together before to have something to talk in common.

&nbsp;

As the image shown above, when I look at two persons coming to me, in the viewport, I can see people with different color of contour. When looking at him using eye tracking technology, some basic infomation will show, such as the last time and place that I met him. This will also give a suggest of our relationship.

&nbsp;

As the image shown above, when someone with criminal record is approching, I will be notified. If the device finds that he is tracking me, the police will also be notified. This can be achieve by using image recognition technology.

&nbsp;

## Second idea: hear about news about oneself from distance

With AR technology, we can input a keyword (ex. a name), whenever someone is talking about this keyword in a limited distance (ex. 10 meters), you will be notified and can know where they are. This can be achieved by using a radar to receive infomations combined with the AR technology to visualize it.

&nbsp;

As we can see in the sketches below, I would like to attach a mini-radar covering a range of about 10m onto the AR HMD. It can work with the other to detect the conversation in this range and filter with keywords provided by me. The message will be shown on the screen with different colors showing their matching rates.

## Third idea: flying experience when travelling

Many of us has the dream of flying like a bird at the early age. In the age of augmented reality, self-driving car will be also developed. By setting a dark environment in a car, we can use HMD to simulate a space in the air with landscape of the Earth below. With the help of some devices simulating the winds and shaking, we can have an experience of flying in the air.

&nbsp;
This can be a great way to kill the time when having nothing to do in a self-driving car. It can also be used when we would like to explore the earth and the places of interest on it like a bird.

# Lecture 8: Prototype

Assignment: Build a prototype (e.g,. paper prototype, WoZ) that is good enough to have a first user exposure.

&nbsp;

In this step, I choose to develop the idea 2 presented above.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

This could be interesting if you find some people talking about something that you are interested. Therefore you can find the people of your same kind. In order not being a tool that violate privacy, the people can have the option of being detected or not. We can think of it as the bluetooth that only the activated devices can be connected together.

&nbsp;

# Lecture 9: Use the prototype for evaluation

Assignment: Ask at least one person (other than you) to interact with your prototype. Observe and discuss with this person what their opinion is towards your concept and interaction. Critically reflect !

&nbsp;

I have asked one of my friends to give me a critical feedback for this idea. His main argument is that for most of us who use this device will make friends easily than before. However, if some evil hackers change it so that the tracking funcionality can be used without users' permissions, it will cause a disaster. Even today, when the tracking is as simple as a coordinate of user, many sensitive information can be related, such as home address. This idea concerns about the points of view towards a subject of someone. If a hacker would like to know the public's opinion towards a subject and track those who are opposite to his/hers, it is possible. Therefore, this idea will cause a critical issue to the freedom of speech.
