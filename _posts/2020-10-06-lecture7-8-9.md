Task: Enhancing human abilities in the age of AR.

# Lecture 7: Ideate
Create and sketch and present at least three ideas.

# Lecture 8: Prototype
Build a prototype (e.g,. paper prototype, WoZ) that is good enough to have a first user exposure

# Lecture 9: Use the prototype for evaluation
Ask at least one person (other then you) to interact with your prototype. Observe and discuss with this
person what their opinion is towards your concept and interaction. Critically reflect !


## Example of Obstruction
The first one is that each time when I open this app, an ads will appear and will show off for 3 seconds. We do have a button to close it, but it is too small and transparent to find it. Here I mark it with a black rectangle.

A way to fix it is simply make the button bigger so that we can react faster. If possible, we can also choose not to visualize it in parameter section.

## Example of Sneaking 
The second one is that some ads will appear along with the content to read. There is a text to mention that it is an ads, but its appearance is totally like a normal content. Here I mark it with a red rectangle.

A way to fix it is to make it different from other normal content, anyway I accept more an ads in such a way.
