# Lab A : setup a blog

# Lab B : setup Unity

## Install Unity Hub

Unity introduces a useful tool that facilitates the installing step and management of different versions, call **Unity Hub**. The step here is quite simple: go to Unity's website and download this tool. After installation, we click the option **installs**, and find the version of the editor that we need to install. There will be a popup asking the extensions that we would like to add on it. I recommand adding **Visual Studio for Unity** and **Documentation**.

## License Management
By clicking the gear icon in *Unity Hub*, we can find a option called **License Management**. It is here that we enter the license info. Normally, we can use personal license for free. It is necessary to have a valide license, if not, we cannot open **Unity Editor**.

&nbsp;

## Create first project with Unity Editor
When a selected editor is already installed, we can create a project with this editor. By clicking the **new** button, a popup with different template will appear. By default, the **3D** template is chosen, meaning that there is only an empty scene for us. At the same time, we can choose a template with a framework on it. For example, here I choose **Karting Microgame**.

### In-Editor tutorial
Since we are beginners right now, Unity provides a handy tool for us to quickly understand how editor works. We will click onto the first one which tell us how to make a play test.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/playtest_1.png "play test starting button"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

Generally speaking, the Unity Editor is seperated by several windows. One of them is called **Game** window, previewing a visual result of our application. Different to **edit mode** in **Scene** window, in **Game** window it is called **play mode**.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/playtest_2.png "play test enter play mode"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

The **play mode** can be stopped at any time by clicking on the same button of playing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The **hierachy** window here shows all the [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameObjects.html) in scene. **Gameobject** is a specific term in Unity, meaning an object like the kart here, or an invisible one like the *GameManager* here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The **inspector** window here shows all the [Components](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html) in scene. Normally, a *GameObject* makes up of several components which can be a script, a **Renderer** or so on. It is the components that define their gameobject. 

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/playtest_5.png "play test inspector window"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

Here, we are modifying the **top speed** variable on an attached script.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/playtest_6.png "play test edit top speed variable"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

After retesting the game, we can find that the maximum speed of the kart is increased. That's all for the first tutorial and we have successfully set up the deveoping environment.

### Personalized elements

We can try adding some personalized elements to know better how it works. Here, we will add an logo into the game. You can download the logo of my school -- IP-Paris [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/ip_paris_logo.png). We need to open the **project** windows which organizes all the assets in *Unity*, and drag & drop the file into **Assets/Karting/Art/Textures** folder.

&nbsp;

We will convert it as **sprite** firstly to use it as UI element.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/addlogo_1.png "converting format"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

The next step is to create a **[Canvas](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/class-Canvas.html)** gameobject because we want to put onto it an image.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/addlogo_2.png "convert format"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

By right clicking the *Canvas*, we are able to create an object whose parent is *Canvas*, we will create an **image** here.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/addlogo_3.png "add Canvas"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

The next step is to modify *image's* property on *inspector* window, by dragging & dropping the logo into the corresponding case.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/addlogo_4.png "add image"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

We will modify *image's* anchor in order to inherit the width and height of the parent object -- *Canvas*.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab1/addlogo_5.png "add image"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

Finally we will rename the *Canvas* as *LogoLeft*, since we will put it on the left side of the starting line. We then duplicate one called *LogoRight*. We will adjust the their position and scale value in **Transform Component**, which are available in the images below. Let's try the game after doing it.
