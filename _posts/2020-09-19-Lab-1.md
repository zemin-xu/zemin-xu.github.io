# Lab A : setup a blog

# Lab B : setup Unity

## Install Unity Hub

Unity introduce a useful tool that facilitate the install step and management of different versions, call **Unity Hub**. The step here is quite simple: go to Unity's website and download this tool. After installation, we click the option **installs**, and find the version of the editor that we need to install. There will be a popup asking the extensions that we would like to add on it. I recommand adding **Visual Studio for Unity** and **Documentation**.

## License Management
By clicking the gear icon in *Unity Hub*, we can find a option called **License Management**. It is here that we enter the license info. Normally, we can use personal license for free. It is necessary to have a valide license, if not, we cannot open **Unity Editor**.

## Create first project with Unity Editor
When a selected editor is already installed, we can create a project with this editor. By clicking the **new** button, a popup with different template will appear. By default, the **3D** template is chosen, meaning that there is only an empty scene for us. At the same time, we can choose a template with a framework on it. For example, here I choose **Karting Microgame**.

Generally speaking, the Unity Editor is seperated by several windows. One of them is called **Game** window, previewing a visual result of our application. Different to **edit mode** in **Scene** window, in **Game** window it is called **play mode**.
