# Lab G : VR Roll-a-Ball Unity

The last lab in HCI course is to convert the tradictional Roll-a-Ball game to that onto VR platform. We use keyboard to control the movement direction of a ball. In VR environment, we can use our hand to manipulate the table and make the ball move.

## Setup HMD

We will use **Oculus Quest** as the main device in this project. There are a handy tool to test our executable easily called *Oculus Link*. With it, we do not have to build the project, transfer it into headset and run the project. All we need is to hit **Play** in *Unity Editor* and test it with headset. To make it work, we need to install **[Oculus Setup](https://www.oculus.com/setup/)** and follow the steps.

## APIs

In this lab, we will use **VRTK 4** to create controller version and use **Oculus Integration** for hand tracking version. We will firstly download the zip file of *VRTK 4* from its [github page](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK) and add this project into Unity Editor(2019.4).

We will then open it and change the project settings's options by enabling the **Virtual Reality Supported**.

Because my **Oculus Link** work perfectly, so I did not change the build settings as **Android**. If not, we will do so.

The next step is to go to the **asset store** in Editor and import **Oculus Integration**. At the same time, we will open our **Roll-a-Ball** project and export it as a package file.
