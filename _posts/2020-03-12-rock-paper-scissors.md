# Rock Paper Scissors Game in AR

Tower Defense is my two-month Unity course assignment, which aims to improve my game design ability and development ability by adapting a classic tower defense gameplay and implementing the adaptation.

Consideration
Before starting production, I thought about what I could change with the classic tower defense gameplay. A classic tower defense gameplay is where the player places defensive items in a fixed area while waves of attacking enemies arrive along a fixed path. I asked myself, would it be more interesting if the towers could be moved, or the towers could interact with each other?

Gameplay
Based on the gameplay of classic tower defense, I've added a special tower that can move and strike to the nearest enemy base automatically. In addition, there is a cooperative mode between towers, that is, when the player selects two towers, they form a boundary between them which will make a greater damage to enemies. In this case, the player can be flexible to change his strategy according to the location of the enemy. In addition, the enemies in this game arrive endlessly, and the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. In the intense phase of the game, the strength of the enemy will be more powerful and their speed will be faster, so it is also a test on player's agility.

Visuals
After the gameplay was fixed, I imagined a story for this game, which takes place in ancient times, where a big flood brought the monster of the sea to the mountain. In order to protect their homes, the animals in the mountain went to fight spontaneously.
	
Phoenix
Phoenix is different from other animals because it is react quickly and can fly to chase his enemy. According to legend, when two phoenixes are combined, they form a wall of fire which creates a greater power.

Rabbit King
The rabbit king has keen eyesight and explosive power. His carrots could be shooted out of the mountain.

Rabbit Queen
The rabbit queen has lots of carrots and can shoot many at once but not very far.
