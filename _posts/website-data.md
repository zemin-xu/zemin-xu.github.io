# Tower defense
/ Game Design / Development / Modeling
Tower Defense is my two-month Unity course assignment, which aims to improve my game design ability and development ability by adapting a classic tower defense gameplay and implementing the adaptation.

Consideration
Before starting production, I thought about what I could change with the classic tower defense gameplay. A classic tower defense gameplay is where the player places defensive items in a fixed area while waves of attacking enemies arrive along a fixed path. I asked myself, would it be more interesting if the towers could be moved, or the towers could interact with each other?

Gameplay
Based on the gameplay of classic tower defense, I've added a special tower that can move and strike to the nearest enemy base automatically. In addition, there is a cooperative mode between towers, that is, when the player selects two towers, they form a boundary between them which will make a greater damage to enemies. In this case, the player can be flexible to change his strategy according to the location of the enemy. In addition, the enemies in this game arrive endlessly, and the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. In the intense phase of the game, the strength of the enemy will be more powerful and their speed will be faster, so it is also a test on player's agility.

Visuals
After the gameplay was fixed, I imagined a story for this game, which takes place in ancient times, where a big flood brought the monster of the sea to the mountain. In order to protect their homes, the animals in the mountain went to fight spontaneously.
	
Phoenix
Phoenix is different from other animals because it is react quickly and can fly to chase his enemy. According to legend, when two phoenixes are combined, they form a wall of fire which creates a greater power.

Rabbit King
The rabbit king has keen eyesight and explosive power. His carrots could be shooted out of the mountain.

Rabbit Queen
The rabbit queen has lots of carrots and can shoot many at once but not very far.

# Mountains & seas
/ Game Design / Development / Modeling
«Mountains and Seas» is my eight-month graduation project in which we should developed in spare time and have three classes to discuss it with tutor. In this project, I started with a topic that I was interested in, found out some limitations of this theme in today's society through investigation, and put forward an idea related to game design. Finally, I completed the implementation of the core gameplay in the prototype stage.

Introduction
«The classic of mountains and seas» is an ancient Chinese book that records the stories of different creatures out of imagination. This book is merely forgotten by this generation, given that the digital entertainment consumes most of their spare time. In this project, I tried to express the unique point in the book -- more than 300 creatures with different looks, stories and special skills, so as to attract people's attention to it.

Researches

There are two researches that are helpful to the development of the project.The first is the theory of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment proposed by Jenova Chen, so as to achieve the high concentration and satisfaction experience of the state of 'flow' in psychology. 

The other one is the re-design of the Celestial Brush in the game «Okami», which concentrates on the special powers of the Celestial Brush. In Japanese mythology, the Celestial Brush has 13 forms and skills, and developers have added them as the core gameplay to okami to impress players. For example, by switching the weapon to the Celestial Brush who controls the moon and drawing circles in the sky, the scene can be turned into night.

Gameplay

Mountains and seas is an open sandbox game which starts with a tutorial of teaching basic operations. It refers to the theory of dynamic difficulty adjustment, and creates the puzzles of the same difficulty level arranged in concentric circles.

Concretely, the gameplay of each creature is specific, designed by its special abilities described in the book. For example, according to the legend, the bird Biyi always come in pairs and only a pair of lovebirds can fly together. Thus, the gameplay here is that players will firstly collect the pieces of them, place them in the right place and rotate them like solving a 3d puzzle. Once finished, the status will recover and carry the player to the mainland of mountains and seas.

More interesting, in the legend, the candle dragon opens its eyes which comes the day and closes its eyes which comes the night. So the gameplay here is coherent: in the boundless darkness, the player needs to find the candle dragon's eyes through the clue, and wakes it up and the world turns back to the day. As players arrive at each new mission, there will be a sign about this creature, and as they approach, there is an audio description of its history and its special ability, which serves to convey the contents of the mountains and seas and enhance a sense of immersion.

# Protect the rabbit
/ Game Design / Modeling / Animation
«Protect the Rabbit» is a VR workshop team project. With four other classmates -- B.Guerin, H.Guibert, B. Trichereau and Y.Makhzoumi, we discussed and decided on the general gameplay on the first day, rapidly iterated on the second and third days, and completed at the end of fourth day. In this project, I was mainly responsible for character's modeling and animation.

Thinking
The purpose of this workshop is to develop a small game through virtual reality technology. On the first day of the discussion we were thinking about what is the difference that VR brings to the video game? On the one hand, VR is suitable for creating immersive experience. On the other hand, different from the input of the handle and keyboard, the input of this support can be the movement of our body and head, which greatly enriches the type of input and makes it more humanized.

Concept
At the end of first day, we came up with an idea that using the movement of both hands. In this game, we play the role of a god like a giant, protecting a rabbit and helping it return to the hole. There will be different hunters and traps along the way. So the left hand represents protection and can stop the rabbit; The right hand represents discipline and is used to remove hunters and traps from the path.

Game Art
In terms of game art, the environment mainly refers to the 2D cardboard style of Mario paper, while the rabbit's shape is still in 3D form. The color of rabbit is mainly yellow warm tone, avoiding contours, in order to highlight its simple and lovely characteristics. The rabbit's has only the action of jumping. Adding the change of transform in unity will achieve the desired jumping effect finally. After completing the task of the rabbit and user test, we found that the tester was often unable to distinguish between left and right hands, so we were agreed to add a hammer to the right hand to make the distinction clear at a glance through the striking action of the hammer. After rapid completion of the hammer modeling, the desired effect was achieved.

Feedback
This game is a simple application of VR technology, in which the interactive actions are not complex, and such cartoon style is suitable for the beginners of VR games. The final effect of this game reached our expectations, and most of the test feedback is positive. However, we also found from the feedback that the task of the game is slightly monotonous. If more factors can be added, for example the rabbit can walk around and the player needs to pay attention to the hunter beside him at any time, such improvement can greatly increase the challenge and playability of the game.

# Revive art
/ Game Design / Development /
«Revive art» is my first semester-long project in school. The theme is "the promotion of indie game". H.Guibert and I worked together on the project. I was responsible for the development, and we decided the game design together.

Gameplay
We thought that indie games are more artistic than AAA games in general, so we asked ourselves a question : can we reach more potential players in art museum or art galleries? Concretely, the idea is to choose an indie game and note down its artistic inspiration by interviewing the creators. After that, an exhibition hall will be well-prepared, where participants are shown paintings or origins of these inspirations. The game requires two people to cooperate. One player wearing VR glasses will find that different paintings are on the ground in his virtual scene. He needs to ask his partner in the real scene the details like which painting corresponds to which year. After replacing all the paintings in order, he will explore the scene created with the assets of this indie game as a reward. The partner in the real scene will find the console unlocked so he can play the indie game there.

# Goblin's treasure
/ Game Design / Modeling
«Goblin's treasure» is the fruit of GameJam workshop. With three other classmates -- T.Dessonet, C.Curial, Y.Makhzoumi, we rapidly decided the concept around the theme "random & loop", iterated it and completed the prototype at the end of fourth day. In this project, I was mainly responsible for modeling of landscape and the gameplay was the result of discussion.

Thinking
This workshop provided me a first experience of Gamejam and Hackathon -- team work, 48h, a theme, and that's all. The terms random and loop made me think of code at once. When doing the brainstorming, I wrote down directly "the random input in loop", things like the player is continuously which also fancied them. When we had an overall concpt of what our game would be like, the tutor gave us another keyword : failure, he then required us to take this keyword into consideration of gameplay.

Gameplay
In this mini-game, the character will keep running on a straight track and chasing a goblin. The input is represented by the turntable in the upper left corner. Each of the four points represents a kind of props, which are randomly determined by the scripts. What the player needs to do is to press the button when the dial pointer and the point coincide exactly, so as to obtain the corresponding props. After acquiring the prop, the player can use it with another key. For example, the mole will slow down the goblin. The concept of random and loop is well-represented here in this turntable.

Modeling
Thanks to this workshop, I learned about building the lowpoly scene with Blender. The effect of lowpoly, combined with the images rendered in Blender, has impressed me and will be used somewhere in my future projects.

# Find Home
/ Game Design / Modeling
«Find H.O.M.E» is a project in which my classmates and I participated in the global game jam in 2019. Based on the theme of home, we completed the concept and prototype of the game together in 48 hours. This project has trained my game design ability, modeling ability and teamwork ability. The other four jammers are S.Gergaud, B.Guerin, N.Herbreteau and S.Reischek.

Experience
“Global Game Jam” is a festival for game makers where each group will produce a prototype during 48h. The theme in January 2019 was "what the home means to you". I was fancinated by the mental connection between family members and had a general idea of touching touching such a feeling when a player is finding his home in game, which shared the same view with my partners. Finally we designed an investigative game whose goal is to help an orphan to find out his lost family. The player will experience the feeling of belonging and will make his choice of contacting his lost family or not in the end.

# Arkea Town
/ Game Design / Prototype
«Arkea town» is a project of group in which we need to learn the Agile method in practice, which is a commonly used theory in workplace. In cooperation with Arkea Bank, we should provide a prototype of introducing tablet utilisation among employees in banks by using gamification. This project has trained my game design ability and teamwork ability. The other three partners are S.Gergaud, N.Herbreteau and L.Renaud. I was in charge of prototype implementation and we decide the gameplay together.

Gamification
In this concept, we finally came up with an imaginary town called Arkea Town, in which each employee in the same agency share a town. With the goal of constructing their town in collaboration, they are supposed to use the Arkea coin to buy the materials. So where comes from the coins? Of course it comes from the daily utilisation of tablet when doing their works.

# The split game
/ Game Design / Development
«the Split Game» is a workshop team project in which students from Game Design and Interaction Design will work together. With three other partners from Interaction Design -- R.Gorenbouh, A.Rabeony and S.Park, we would come up with a gameplay which uses a "joypad" as input. Later we would rapidly make a prototype thanks to Processing and Arduino. completed at the end of fourth day. In this project, I was mainly responsible for development and we decided the gameplay together.

Gameplay
Unlike keyboard, joypad is mainly used in arcade game which returns a better feedback of pressing. However the joypad here means the intallation the we combine by using different kinds of captures. We were inspired by the game «Braid» and tried using the two sides of screen as two parts of the game. The side on top is more difficulty because the direction of gravity is upper. The interesting part of this projet is that we can make use of many kinds of input like light, sound, pressure etc. and create some cool things by combining them. Therefore, we used foot as a natural input like when we are driving.
