# Revive art

**Revive art** is my first semester-long project in school. The theme is "the promotion of indie game". H.Guibert and I worked together on the project. I was responsible for the development, and we decided the game design together.

## Gameplay

We thought that indie games are more artistic than AAA games in general, so we asked ourselves a question : can we reach more potential players in art museum or art galleries? Concretely, the idea is to choose an indie game and note down its artistic inspiration by interviewing the creators. After that, an exhibition hall will be well-prepared, where participants are shown paintings or origins of these inspirations. The game requires two people to cooperate. One player wearing VR glasses will find that different paintings are on the ground in his virtual scene. He needs to ask his partner in the real scene the details like which painting corresponds to which year. After replacing all the paintings in order, he will explore the scene created with the assets of this indie game as a reward. The partner in the real scene will find the console unlocked so he can play the indie game there.
