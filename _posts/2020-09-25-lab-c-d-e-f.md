# Lab C D E F : Follow Machine Learning tutorial to learn Unity's ML-Agents package

## Tranditional AI vs AI trained by Machine Learning
Traditional AI is implemented by programmers by setting specific rules and states. For example, for navigation of AI, there are different pathfinding algorithms. Different to traditional way, in machine-learning way we do not provide specific implementation for the AI, also called **agents**. We make them **intelligent** by training them. One way of training is to setup a system of rewards. Like the learning process of children or pets, we make agents learn by giving them rewards or punishment. The agents will try interacting with their environment and they will get different rewards according to their behaviours. The agents will update their way to get the maximum reward. This way is a subset of machine learning and is also call **Reinforcement Learning**. 

## ML-Agents
The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API.

## Hummingbirds
In this lab we will follow a tutorial on Unity Learn platform called [HummingBirds](https://learn.unity.com/course/ml-agents-hummingbirds). The instuctor is Adam Kelly.
> We will learn how to create intelligent flying hummingbirds that can navigate to flowers, dip their beaks in, and drink nectar. These hummingbirds have six degrees of freedom, meaning they can fly and turn in any direction to find targets. They have more complicated controls and their flight paths cannot be solved with traditional navigation systems. You will learn how to craft a training environment and train neural networks to perform this challenging task.

### observation
bool, raycast
tuto's ideas: agents current rotation(queternion), dir and dis to nearest flower, becks to point at the flower, raycast to avoid obstacles

### reward
positive, negative

turn to the nearest flower : 10p
move to : 1p
get beck into it : 100p
finish a flower: 10000p

ideas in tuto:
a small positive : birds beak in flower
a big negative : touching ground and rocks
