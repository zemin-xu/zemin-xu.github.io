Under construction.

# Introduction

This post is my notes of series released by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com) on neural network and machine learning. In this series, he used an example of how computer recognizes hand written digits from 0 to 9 by constructing its own neural network.

## Neuron & Activation

The *neuron* is the smallest element and that the number in a neuron is called its activation. Activation of a neuron in different layer can have different meanings. For example, in the first layer, the activation means the graysacle of where the neuron is. In the last layer, it means the probalibity of a certain digit.

## Layers

### Why the layers

Hidden layers

The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activation of the next layers.

# Machine Learning
