# Lecture A: Affordance
Find and document (Video/Picture) one bad and one good affordance in your daily life (also digital). Explain why they are good or bad and suggest how you could fix the bad ones.

# Lecture B: Gestalt Laws 
Find and document two applications of Gestalt laws in your daily life (also digital) which went wrong and suggest how to correct them.

# Lecture C: Dark Design Pattern
I use an application which is a chinese version of *[Quora](https://www.quora.com/)*. There are two examples of dark design pattern, apparently for profit.

## Example of Obstruction
The first one is that each time when I open this app, an ads will appear and will show off for 3 seconds. We do have a button to close it, but it is too small and transparent to find it. Here I mark it with a black rectangle.

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is simply make the button bigger so that we can react faster. If possible, we can also choose not to visualize it in parameter section.

## Example of Sneaking 
The second one is that some ads will appear along with the content to read. There is a text to mention that it is an ads, but its appearance is totally like a normal content. Here I mark it with a red rectangle.

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is to make it different from other normal content, anyway I accept more an ads in such a way.
