# Lecture 1: Affordance

In daily life there are many of examples about affordance.

## Good Example of Affordance

A good affordance for me is that it can make its usage immediately obvious without manual. I take the example of socket. The protruding part and the depressed part onto the wall are so obvious and unique that we cannot think of another way to make it work.

## Bad Example of Affordance

A bad affordance for me is that, as users, we need to take several seconds to think about how it works, normally because the straight forward way does not work. I take an example of the access control system of my residence. Normally we need a card to open the door by swiping it in front of this system. However, I get always confused which part to get closed.

# Lecture 2: Gestalt Laws 
Find and document two applications of Gestalt laws in your daily life (also digital) which went wrong and suggest how to correct them.

# Lecture 3: Dark Design Pattern
I use an application which is a chinese version of *[Quora](https://www.quora.com/)*. There are two examples of dark design pattern, apparently for profit.

## Example of Obstruction
The first one is that each time when I open this app, an ads will appear and will show off for 3 seconds. We do have a button to close it, but it is too small and transparent to find it. Here I mark it with a black rectangle.

A way to fix it is simply make the button bigger so that we can react faster. If possible, we can also choose not to visualize it in parameter section.

## Example of Sneaking 
The second one is that some ads will appear along with the content to read. There is a text to mention that it is an ads, but its appearance is totally like a normal content. Here I mark it with a red rectangle.

A way to fix it is to make it different from other normal content, anyway I accept more an ads in such a way.
