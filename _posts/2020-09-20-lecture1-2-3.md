# Lecture 1: Affordance

Assignment: Find and document (Video/Picture) one bad and one good affordance in your daily life (also digital). Explain why they are good or bad and suggest how you could fix the bad ones.

&nbsp;

In daily life there are many of examples about affordance.

## Good Example of Affordance

A good affordance for me is that it can make its usage immediately obvious without manual. I take the example of socket. The protruding part and the depressed part onto the wall are so obvious and unique that we cannot think of another way to make it work.

## Bad Example of Affordance

A bad affordance for me is that, as users, we need to take several seconds to think about how it works, normally because the straight forward way does not work. I take an example of the access control system of my residence. Normally we need a card to open the door by swiping it in front of this system. However, I get always confused which part to get closed.

&nbsp;

The right part to make it work is the lower one with blue light. However it is not a good example of affordance. My solution is to either remove the one of the black part, or add an icon of card onto the screen.

# Lecture 2: Gestalt Laws

Assignment: Find and document two applications of Gestalt laws in your daily life (also digital) which went wrong and suggest how to correct them.

&nbsp;

## Law of Similarity

> The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other. This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities. -- Dr. Debashri R Banerjee

###### https://www.verywellmind.com/gestalt-laws-of-perceptual-organization-2795835

## Wrong Example

In web design, there are many cool websites with amazing visual effects. However, some of them violate the basic principles of design and make it unnecessary. [Bermat](https://bermat.it/it) is one of them that breaks the law of Similarity for nothing. As we can see in the picture below, the animated shadow will hide some alphabets and make a word as two different parts. However, apart from visual effect, there is no any other functions by doing so. For me, it is a waste of performance for nothing.

A possible solution is to make the shadow appear somewhere that will not influence the recognition of words.

## Law of Closure

> The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. -- Dr. Debashri R Banerjee

###### https://www.verywellmind.com/gestalt-laws-of-perceptual-organization-2795835

&nbsp;

### Wrong Example

[Heytempo](https://www.heytempo.com/) is a site for HR and naturally we are concentrating on the fancy typography at a glimpse. However, we can find that the white lines on the typography is unnecessary at all. Because of law of closure, we are linking these white lines together to get a extra message but we cannot find anything and we waste several seconds for thinking about it.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lecture/tempo.png "heytempo"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

A potential solution is to delicately reorganise the position of these lines to form an extra infomation.

# Lecture 3: Dark Design Pattern

Assignment: Find and document two dark design pattern and discuss how you could redesign them to achieve the opposite.

&nbsp;

I use an application which is a chinese version of *[Quora](https://www.quora.com/)* called [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/). There are two examples of dark design pattern inside it, apparently for profit.

## Obstruction

> Making a process more difficult than it needs to be, with
the intent of dissuading certain action(s). -- Gray, Kou, Battles, Hoggatt & Toombs

### Example

The first one is that each time when I open this app, an ads will appear and will show off for 3 seconds. We do have a button to close it, but it is too small and transparent to find it. Here I mark it with a black rectangle.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lecture/obstruction.png "example of obstruction"){:width="50%"}

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is simply make the button bigger so that we can react faster. If possible, we can also choose not to visualize it in parameter section.

&nbsp;

## Sneaking

> Attempting to hide, disguise, or delay the divulging of
information that is relevant to the user. -- Gray, Kou, Battles, Hoggatt & Toombs

&nbsp;

### Example

The second one is that some ads will appear along with the content to read. There is a text to mention that it is an advertisement, but its appearance is totally like a normal content. Here I mark it with a red rectangle.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lecture/sneaking.png "example of sneaking"){:width="50%"}

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is to make it different from other normal content, anyway I accept more an advertisement in such a way.
