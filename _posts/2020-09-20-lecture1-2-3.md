# Lecture 1: Affordance

In daily life there are many of examples about affordance.

## Good Example of Affordance

A good affordance for me is that it can make its usage immediately obvious without manual. I take the example of socket. The protruding part and the depressed part onto the wall are so obvious and unique that we cannot think of another way to make it work.

## Bad Example of Affordance

A bad affordance for me is that, as users, we need to take several seconds to think about how it works, normally because the straight forward way does not work. I take an example of the access control system of my residence. Normally we need a card to open the door by swiping it in front of this system. However, I get always confused which part to get closed.

Well the right one is the lower one with blue light. However it is not a good example of affordance. My solution is to either remove the one of the black part, or add an icon of card onto the part that make it work.

# Lecture 2: Gestalt Laws 

I find two website that seem pretty but some elements violate Gestalt Laws.

## Wrong Example of Law of Similarity

> The principle of similarity states that when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together and we also tend to think they have the same function.

In web design there are many of cool websites with amazing visual effects. However, some of them violate the basic principles of design and make it unnecessary. [Bermat](https://bermat.it/it) is one of them.

## Wrong Example of Law of Closure

> The principle of closure states that when we look at a complex arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.

&nbsp;

[Heytempo](https://www.heytempo.com/) is a site for HR and naturally we are concentrating on the fancy typography at a glimpse. However, we can find that the white lines on the typography is unnecessary at all. Because of law of closure, we are linking these white lines together to get a extra message but we cannot find anything and we waste several seconds.

A potential solution is to delicately reorganise the position of these lines to form an extra infomation.

# Lecture 3: Dark Design Pattern

I use an application which is a chinese version of *[Quora](https://www.quora.com/)*. There are two examples of dark design pattern, apparently for profit.

## Example of Obstruction

The first one is that each time when I open this app, an ads will appear and will show off for 3 seconds. We do have a button to close it, but it is too small and transparent to find it. Here I mark it with a black rectangle.

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is simply make the button bigger so that we can react faster. If possible, we can also choose not to visualize it in parameter section.

## Example of Sneaking 
The second one is that some ads will appear along with the content to read. There is a text to mention that it is an ads, but its appearance is totally like a normal content. Here I mark it with a red rectangle.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is to make it different from other normal content, anyway I accept more an ads in such a way.
