# Natural Communication in HRI

## communication process

sender->transmit->receiver

message: physical form of idea or information that can be understood through receiver's sensory receptors

communication: verbal, para-verbal, non-verbal

Albert Mehrabian: 55% by body language, 38% by tone of the voice, 7% by the words
"A wealth of information about non verbal communication"

## multi-modal should be used

Affect: an expressed or observed emotional response

Intentionality: capacity of mental states to be directed toward or be in relation with something in the external world

Emotions: a form on non verbal communication that we typically use as human beings to reflect our physiological and mental state

Emotions are reflected in voice, hand and body gestures, and mainly through facial expressions.

## Basic and Complex Emotion Models
Izard: 10 primary emotions, 1977
Ekman: 6 fundamental emotions, 1982
Tomkins: 9 primary emotions, 1984

Plutchik: 3D circumplex wheel(intensity, similarity, polarity), 1991

TAME framework: Traits, Attitudes, Moods, Emotions
