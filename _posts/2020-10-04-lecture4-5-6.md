## Example of Obstruction
The first one is that each time when I open this app, an ads will appear and will show off for 3 seconds. We do have a button to close it, but it is too small and transparent to find it. Here I mark it with a black rectangle.

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is simply make the button bigger so that we can react faster. If possible, we can also choose not to visualize it in parameter section.

## Example of Sneaking 
The second one is that some ads will appear along with the content to read. There is a text to mention that it is an ads, but its appearance is totally like a normal content. Here I mark it with a red rectangle.

&nbsp;

A way to fix it is to make it different from other normal content, anyway I accept more an ads in such a way.
