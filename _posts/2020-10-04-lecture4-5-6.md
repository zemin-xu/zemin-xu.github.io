# Lecture 4: Present one HCI Researcher

Assignment: Find one current researcher in the field of HCI (you can use google scholar) and write about ONE of her/his current research projects in the general field of HCI.

&nbsp;

> Meredith Ringel Morris is a Sr. Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research and Research Area Manager for Interaction, Accessibility, and Mixed Reality. -- Microsoft Research

&nbsp;

Her latest paper with SHAUN K. KANE and ANHONG GUO named **Sense and Accessibility: Understanding People with Physical Disabilities’ Experiences with Sensing Systems** did a survey with people with physical disabilities and made a description about their experiences with a variety of sensing systems. This research is ended with their reflections on the significations of these findings for creating a more inclusive sensing systems.

&nbsp;

In this paper, they use the same definition of “sensing systems” as Bellotti et al., who define sensing systems as including “ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems, speech and audio input, gesture-based input, tangible interfaces....and context-aware computing.”

&nbsp;

HCI course concentrates on the interactive way between human beings and machines and the ways mentioned above are almost all. However, some of these ways assume that the users have the ability of doing these interactions. The fact is that some of us are excluded. This paper is trying do figure out the actual situations which all of us should know for creating a more inclusive interactive systems.

&nbsp;

One of the project that she participated is called **Accessible Mixed Reality** which is concentrating on how to design emerging Mixed Reality technologies to be useful to people of all abilities, which is also related to the paper presented above.

# Lecture 5: Read the Ultimate Display by Ivan Sutherland

Assignment: Read the “Ultimate Display” and discuss what Ivan Sutherland was able to predict that currently is already happening and try to think what of his vision could potential become reality in the future ?

&nbsp;

> The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. -- Ivan Sutherland

&nbsp;

The room that the computer can control the existance of objects is already happening and is reference to virtual reality device. The ability of use the movement of eyes to control computer is also realized, which can be found in some laptops having eye tracking funtionality.

&nbsp;

> The computer can easily sense the positions of almost any of our body muscles. So far only the muscles of the hands and arms have been used for computer control. There is no reason why these should be the only ones, although our dexterity with them is so high that they are a natural choice. Our eye dexterity is very high also. Machines to sense and interpret eye motion data can and will be built. It remains to be seen if we can use a language of glances to control a computer. An interesting experiment will be to make the display presentation depend on where we look. -- Ivan Sutherland

&nbsp;

The opinion that the computer can sense the position of a man's muscles and interpret it has not been realized yet. However it will become reality in the future because our body language can bring much more infomation. What's more, it is more natural to use the confortable part of our body to control the computer. A boxing game with keyboard input will be far less interesting than that with sensation of muscles.

# Lecture 6: Input Devices and Interaction Paradigms

Assignment: Present and classify (what type of User Interface) ONE new or failed input device/technique that was presented in research and media. Discuss why you think the input device did not succeed (failed one) or why it will/won’t succeed in the future (new one). (https://www.youtube.com/user/acmsigchi)

&nbsp;

The **Gesture Input Method Based on Breathing** proposed by *Takahiro Kusabuka* and *Takuya Indo* is a nouvel gesture input which use the breathing to make simple inputs. It should be classified as **Gesture Interface**. In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFIDXsRqt4), a demo using breathing to control the playing and pause functionality of music is presented. The main use of this input system is to avoid spreading the virus and infectious diseases by not touching the screen of smartphone.

&nbsp;

In my opinion, this input device will not succeed in the future. In the demostration, we can see that to make a simple input, we should rotate our neck as well as breath in and out as much as air in order to make sensor activated. People will quickly get tired after having to do so, with a mask onto their face. It is merely impossible to do a frequent input in this way. 

Another limitation is that the combination is limited by breathing. However, in these days with coronavirus , this input system will be useful to do some simple inputs in public space.
