# Lecture 4: Present one HCI Researcher

Assignment: Find one current researcher in the field of HCI (you can use google scholar) and write about ONE of her/his current research projects in the general field of HCI.

&nbsp;

> Meredith Ringel Morris is a Sr. Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research and Research Area Manager for Interaction, Accessibility, and Mixed Reality.

&nbsp;

Her latest paper with SHAUN K. KANE and ANHONG GUO named **Sense and Accessibility: Understanding People with Physical Disabilities’ Experiences with Sensing Systems** did a survey with people with physical disabilities and made a description about their experiences with a variety of sensing systems. This research is ended with their reflections on the significations of these findings for creating a more inclusive sensing systems.

&nbsp;

One of the project that she participated is called **Accessible Mixed Reality** which is concentrating on how to design emerging Mixed Reality technologies to be useful to people of all abilities.

# Lecture 5: Read the Ultimate Display by Ivan Sutherland

Assignment: Read the “Ultimate Display” and discuss what Ivan Sutherland was able to predict that currently is already happening and try to think what of his vision could potential become reality in the future ? 

&nbsp;

The room that the computer can control the existance of objects is already happening and is reference to virtual reality device. The ability of use the movement of eyes to control computer is also realized.

&nbsp;

The opinion that the computer can sense the position of a man's muscles and interpret it has not been realized yet. However it will become reality in the future because our body language can bring some infomations. What's more, it is more natural to use the confortable part of our body to control the computer.

# Lecture 6: Input Devices and Interaction Paradigms

Assignment: Present and classify (what type of User Interface) ONE new or failed input device/technique that was presented in research and media. Discuss why you think the input device did not succeed (failed one) or why it will/won’t succeed in the future (new one). (https://www.youtube.com/user/acmsigchi)

&nbsp;

The **Gesture Input Method Based on Breathing** proposed by *Takahiro Kusabuka* and *Takuya Indo* is a nouvel gesture input which use the breathing to make simple inputs. In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFIDXsRqt4), a demo application using breathing to control the playing and pause functionality is presented. The main use of this input system is to avoid spreading the virus and infectious diseases.

&nbsp;

In my opinion, this input device will not succeed in the future. In the demostration, we can see that to make a input, we should rotate our neck as well as breath in and out as much as air in order to make sensor activated. People will quickly get tired after having to do so, with a mask onto their face. It is merely impossible to do a frequent input in this way. What's more, the combination is limited by breathing. However, in these days with coronavirus circuiting, this input system will be useful to do some simput inputs in public space.
