# Lab G : VR Roll-a-Ball Unity

The last lab in HCI course is to convert the tradictional Roll-a-Ball game to that onto VR platform. We use keyboard to control the movement direction of a ball. In VR environment, we can use our hand to manipulate the table and make the ball move.

## Setup HMD

We will use **Oculus Quest** as the main device in this project. There are a handy tool to test our executable easily called *Oculus Link*. With it, we do not have to build the project, transfer it into headset and run the project. All we need is to hit **Play** in *Unity Editor* and test it with headset. To make it work, we need to install **[Oculus Setup](https://www.oculus.com/setup/)** and follow the steps.

## Editor Setup

In this lab, we will use **VRTK 4** to create controller version and use **Oculus Integration** for hand tracking version. We will firstly download the zip file of *VRTK 4* from its [github page](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK) and add this project into Unity Editor(2019.4).

&nbsp;

We will then open it and change the project settings's options by enabling the **Virtual Reality Supported**.

&nbsp;

Because my **Oculus Link** work perfectly, so I did not change the build settings as **Android**. If not, we will do so.

&nbsp;

The next step is to go to the **Asset Store** in Editor and import **Oculus Integration**. At the same time, we will open our **Roll-a-Ball** project and export it as a package file. If we do not have this project done, we can also search for it onto **Asset Store** and use the complete project.

&nbsp;

There will be conflicts because of some same-name situations in APIs and our projects. For example, I encountered the namespace error for *PlayerController.cs*. We can simply fix it by adding a namespace for Roll-a-Ball's script.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/add_namespace.png "add namespace"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

At this stage, we will have no compile error and we can test the demo in **VRTK 4** to test **Oculus Link**.

&nbsp;

## Composing Scene

### Create new scene

The next thing to do is to compose the elements that we need to make a Roll-a-Ball VR game. To do so, we will create a new scene and delete the default camera. The second step is to create a huge floor for VR and add a Cube as a table. We will act as a giant and manipulate the it. We can group them into a empty gameobject call *env*.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/composition_scene.png "composition"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

### Add Roll-a-Ball elements

We will grab into the scene the elements of *Roll-a-Ball* and group it into a same named empty gameobject. All of the sub-elements should at the same child hierarchy.

&nbsp;

The next step is to add a **Box Collider** component and modify the parameters **Transform** and **Box Collider** as image below.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/physics_settings.png "physics settings"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

One problem about physics is that the player will collide with this empty gameobject. To avoid this, we can use layers to differentiate them. We will add two layers: **VRGrab** and **Roll-a-ball**. We will then modify the **Physics** in **Project Settings** by deselecting the common case of *VRGrab* and **Roll-a-ball**, as image above. In this case, there will be no physics reactions between these two layers.

&nbsp;

We will then change the *Roll-a-ball* gameobject's layer as **VRGrab**, with option of changing this object only. Then, we will change all its child gameobjects as *Roll-a-ball* layer, with option of changing children as well.

&nbsp;

### Add VR-related Controllers

Next thing is to add the VR-related controllers that are already prepared in *VRTK 4* and *Oculus* packages.

&nbsp;

step 1: add the **OVRCameraRig** prefab (Project > Oculus > VR > Prefabs) in scene and Change the *Tracking Origin Type* as **Floor Level**.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/floor_level.png "ovr camera rig prefab"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

step 2: click to develop the **OVRCameraRig** gameobject, and drag the corresponding child gameobject into its **Linked Alias Association Collection** component as image below.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/linked_alias.png "linked alias"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

step 3: for each of **Left Hand Anchor** and **Right Hand Anchor** gameobjects, drag the **OVRControllerPrefab**(Projects > Oculus > VR > Prefabs) as their child. Then, set the **Controller** option of **OVR Controller Helper** component as **L Touch** and **R Touch** seperately.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/linked_alias.png "linked alias"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

step 4: add **Tracked Alias** (Projects > Packages > VRTK Prefabs > CameraRig) as a child gameobject of **OVRCameraRig** and drag **OVRCameraRig** as the reference of **Elements** slot, as image below.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/tracked_alias.png "tracked alias"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

step 5: add **Interactor**(Project > Packages > VRTK Prefabs > Interactions > Interactors) as a child as **LeftControllerAlias** and **RightControllerAlias** gameobject.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/interactor.png "interactor"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

step 6: create an empty gameobject in the scene and name it as **LeftTriggerAxis**, then add a **Unity Axis 1D Action** component onto it. This script is use to detect the input on the left trigger and convert it as some other values. Change the value as **VRTK_Axis9_LeftTrigger**.

&nbsp;

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/left_trigger_axis.png "trigger axis"){:width="100%"}

&nbsp;

step 7: create an empty gameobject and name it as **LeftTriggerPressed**, add **FloatToBoolean** and **BooleanAction** component onto it. After that, change the value of **Positive Bounds** and **Value Changed(Boolean)** as image below.

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zemin-xu/zemin-xu.github.io/master/assets/images/hci_lab3/unity_axis_action.png "axis action"){:width="100%"}
