# Human 3D Pose Reconstruction Lab

The purpose of the lab is to implement the 3D reconstruction from multi-views of human pose on a calibrated system. The course and lab is provided by Tan-Khoa MAI in Telecom-SudParis, at ARTEMIS research group. The dataset and part of code are provided by him.

&nbsp;

Generally speaking, the dataset is composed of original videos from cameras of different views and text data about camera parameters and coordinates output of joints generated by *deepnet*.

&nbsp;

Videos are different sportive activities recorded by different people(subject).

&nbsp;

Two type of data are important here: **2DTXT** file and **3DTXT** file. The 2DTXT contains arrays of 2D coordinates for each joint at each frame. The 3DTXT contains one more dimension coordinate information.

&nbsp;

The whole lab is divided by 4 sub-tasks.

#### draw keypoints on original videos with 2DTXT file
